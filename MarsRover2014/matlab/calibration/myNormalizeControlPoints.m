%   computes a normalized control points matrix ptsNorm. The centroid of
%   ptsNorm is centered at the origin. The RMS distance from the origin of
%   ptsNorm is sqrt(2). The second output argument normMatrixInv defines a
%   3x3 similarity matrix normMatrixInv is a similarity matrix that is the
%   inverse of the scale and shift applied during point normalization. This
%   is used to denormalize the homography computed as an overconstrained
%   least squares problem.
