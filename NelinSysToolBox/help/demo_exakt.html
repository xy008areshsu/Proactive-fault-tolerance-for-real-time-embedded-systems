<H2>Exact linearization - demo simulations</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This part of the <I>NelinSys</I> library contains three demos illustrating the use of its function blocks for simulation of exact linearization control loops. Simulation of chosen example is started automatically, immediately after its selection from the menu (see the following picture) and during its first run it cannot be stopped - modifications of the simulation scheme are allowed only after the first simulation is over.</P>

The simulation shows the rise of the field current at the time instant <I>t<SUB>1</SUB> = 0s</I>, the start of the motor without a load at the time <I>t<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.3s</I>, its load at the time <I>t<SUB>3</SUB> = 2s</I> and the decrease in the field current at the time <I>t<SUB>4</SUB> = 4s</I>.

The system contains unstable internal dynamics, which means that calculated controller is practically useless. The consequences of this instability can be seen from the state responses of the system - the <I>x<SUB>3</SUB></I> variable tends to infinity. Simulation results:</P>
