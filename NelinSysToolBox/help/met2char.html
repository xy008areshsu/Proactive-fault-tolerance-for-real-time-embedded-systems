<H2>Two-Characteristics Method</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two-Characteristics Method is a graphical (or both graphical and analytical) method for analysis of limit cycles that occur in nonlinear systems. It requires a nonlinear system composed of a high-order linear part and an isolated static nonlinearity (see the picture below). The method is also known as Harmonic Balance or Describing Function Method in literature, however, these two terms can be understood as general principles and can be used for other purposes e.g. PID controller tuning, too, while Two-Characteristics Method is restricted only to limit cycle analysis.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="met2char_obvod.gif" ALT="Nonlinear system suitable for analysis via Two-Characteristics Method"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two-Characteristics method is based upon describing functions and assumes following requirements to be satisfied:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the system is composed of an isolated nonlinearity and a linear part
<LI>the system is autonomous i.e. it has no inputs
<LI>the nonlinearity is centrally symmetrical
<LI>the nonlinearity is static i.e. its describing function does not depend on frequency
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a more detailed description of the method, see literature dealing with nonlinear control systems. The <I>Met2Char</I> application implementing the method is available in two versions - a <A HREF="#GrafRozhr">GUI version</A> and a <A HREF="#TextRozhr">text-based version</A>.</P>

<H3>Graphical user interface (GUI)</H3>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="met2char_dialog.jpg" ALT="Graphical user interface of the Met2Char application"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The GUI version of the <I>Met2Char</I> application lets user decide if there exists a limit cycle in the nonlinear system. It also allows to determine the number of limit cycles in case there are more. The harmonic balance equation is solved only graphically, for an analytical solution the text-based version has to be used. Description of GUI-controls:</P>

<H3>Text-based user interface</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Text-based version of the <I>Met2Char</I> application can be found in <I>\TextRozhr</I> subdirectory. It is run from MATLAB Command Window by typing <I>met2char</I>. From the operational point of view, this version allows user to do everything that is possible to do with GUI version, besides, unlike the GUI version, it is able to solve the harmonic balance equation analytically (through Symbolic Math Toolbox) i.e. it can calculate numerical values of amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle(s). Usage example:</P>

HARMONIC BALANCE, ANALYSIS OF LIMIT CYCLES (Two-Characteristics Method)
                            
-------- Linear part of the system --------

Transfer function - numerator: 200
Transfer function - denominator: [1e-3 7e-2 1 0]

Transfer function:
          200
------------------------
0.001 s^3 + 0.07 s^2 + s

Minimum frequency "w": 1
Maximum frequency "w": 100
Frequency step size: 1

-------------- Nonlinearity -------------

 1 - ideal relay
 2 - relay with dead-zone
 3 - relay with hysteresis
 4 - saturation

Chosen nonlinearity: 1

Relay gain: K = 2

Minimum amplitude: 1
Maximum amplitude: 100
Amplitude step size: 1

-------- Graphical solution --------

Frequency characteristic of the linear part is plotted in blue colour.
Characteristic corresponding to the nonlinearity is plotted in red colour.

The number of intersections of these two characteristics determines the number of limit cycles.

Do you want to change axes settings? (Y/N) y
Specify new settings: [Re-min, Re-max, Im-min, Im-max] = [-15 0 -10 2]

-------- Stability evaluation --------

The rule: a limit cycle is stable if the characteristic corresponding to the nonlinearity
          (the red one) crosses the frequency characteristic (the blue one) from right to left
          (in terms of increasing values of "w").

Beginning of the frequency characteristic: w = 1.000000, Re(Fw) = -13.959503, Im(Fw) = -199.222057
End of frequency characteristic: w = 100.000000, Re(Fw) = -0.107692, Im(Fw) = 0.138462

Beginning of the nonlinearity characteristic: A = 1.000000, Re(-1/Fa) = -0.392699, Im(-1/Fa) = 0.000000
End of the nonlinearity characteristic A = 100.000000, Re(-1/Fa) = -39.269908, Im(-1/Fa) = 0.000000

-------- Analytical solution --------

Calculated limit cycle parameters:
 Amplitude: a = 7.27565, Frequency: w = 31.62278
