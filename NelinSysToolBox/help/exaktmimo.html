<H2>Exact linearization for MIMO systems</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>ExaktMimo</I> application serves as a tool for exact linearization of nonlinear MIMO systems with the same number of inputs and outputs. It calculates both the <A HREF="transf_mimo.html"><I>state coordinates transformation</I></A> and the <A HREF="lineariz_mimo.html"><I>nonlinear feedback (linearizing control law)</I></A> - two main results of the control design procedure that can be utilised in simulation or in physical implementation of the controller. There are two versions of the application - a <A HREF="#GrafRozhr">GUI version</A> and a <A HREF="#TextRozhr">text-based version</A>.</P>

<H3>Simulation of designed closed-loop system</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>ExaktMimo</I> application lets user evaluate the performance of designed control loop (by means of simulation) immediately after the control law is calculated. The simulation scheme employed requires only very little user intervention before it is able to be run - parameters of the blocks <I>Controlled system</I> (except for initial values of state variables), <I>State-Coordinates transformation</I> and <I>Compensation of nonlinearities</I> are taken from the <I>ExaktMimo</I> application via symbolic variables <I>F</I>, <I>G</I>, <I>H</I>, <I>u</I>, <I>qx</I>, <I>n</I> and <I>r</I>.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="exaktmimo_simulacia.jpg" ALT="Simulation of designed control loop"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The simulation scheme contains a linear pole-placement MIMO state-space controller whose parameters are desired poles of the closed-loop system (number of these poles has to be equal to system total relative degree), however, the use of this controller is not compulsory, it can be replaced with arbitrary other suitable linear controller. Similarly, the <I>Desired value</I> block can be replaced with any other type of input signal.</P>
