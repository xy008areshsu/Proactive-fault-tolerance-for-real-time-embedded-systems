<H2>Gain-Scheduling control for SISO systems</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <I>ProgZos</I> application serves as a tool for design of state-space controllers for SISO systems via gain scheduling (the method is also known as extended linearization). The design of parametric linear controller is performed via pole placement. There are two versions of the application - a <A HREF="#GrafRozhr">GUI version</A> and a <A HREF="#TextRozhr">text-based version</A>.</P>

<H3>Text-based user interface</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Text-based version of the <I>ProgZos</I> application can be found in <I>\TextRozhr</I> subdirectory. It is run from MATLAB Command Window by typing <I>progzos</I>. From the operational point of view, this version allows user to do everything that is possible to do with GUI version, besides, unlike the GUI version, it is able to cope with non-numeric parameters (symbols other than <I>x</I>) in the expressions <I>f(x)</I>, <I>g(x)</I>, <I>h(x)</I>. Moreover, it displays intermediate data of the controller design e.g. matrices <I>A, B, C, D</I> corresponding to the linearization of the nonlinear system in the neighbourhood of chosen (variable, non-fixed) operating point.
