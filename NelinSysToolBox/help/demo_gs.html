<H2>Gain Scheduling - demo simulations</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This part of the <I>NelinSys</I> library contains two demos illustrating the use of its function blocks for simulation of nonlinear systems controlled by gain-scheduled controllers. Simulation of chosen example is started automatically, immediately after its selection from the menu (see the following picture) and during its first run it cannot be stopped - modifications of the simulation scheme are allowed only after the first simulation is over.</P>

<H3>Input and output gain scheduling</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simulation of gain-scheduled control of a <I>2 tanks without interaction</I> nonlinear system (both input and output scheduling is included). The nonlinear system is described by following equations:</P>

<H3>Comparison with exact linearization</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simulation of control of a <I>2 tanks without interaction</I> SISO system (see the state-space description above) by different types of controllers: linear controller designed for fixed operating point <I>y0 = 1</I>, input and output gain-scheduled controllers and exact-linearization-based controller.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Synthesis of the gain-scheduled controllers and the fixed-point linear controller was carried out through the <A HREF="progzos.html"><I>ProgZos</I></A> application, while the exact linearization control design was performed by the <A HREF="exaktsiso.html"><I>ExaktSiso</I></A> application.
